### your past track record is not everything

Idea is great, execution matters more. 
Having **toy stage idea is great** and you can forge greater idea, which will gradually become fundable startup idea during cohort.
We are pretty inspired by buildspace on this and we believe grinders peer pressure would be great.

### Hot-topics to build on
This is list of suggestion we might come to our mind, yet we encourage **you need to be passionate about your idea and even better is if you have something in your mind what you would like to see being build.** Not just build around it, because we suggest it might be thrilling.

Take it more like bootcamp to sharp your skills and experience along the journey.

We are thinking to start last week of September, no hard dates, probably around 30/9/2023.

What is SubWork Fellowship?
---
It's unique experience set in beautiful nature of Bled, located in SubWork. Where daily grind will happen and we will have few workshops going on daily basis preferably to chat, discuss and elaborate on disrupting topics. Weekly basis included with outdoor programme to foster relationships with some adventures, i.e. cold plunges, bathing in lakes, long-range hikes, ebike rides around local mountains to enjoy scenic views and all that activities you can do in surroundings.

We will work on your wellbeing, healthy routines, delivery of code, iteration of idea you have and ways how you can be funded.

We believe SubWork Fellowship will be social building block of more broader vision of SubWork for the future, i.e. making small technological village with perks of nature.


Is it incubator?

We ultimately believe when we will be playing positive sum games and your success will give it back to community as we build long-term community with horizon 5+ years. You can have chance be star of this economical cycle.

What will you get?
---
For your time commitment, you have chance to asymmetrically change your life. It will be transformational experience both for participants, mentors and collaborators. It's will be diametrically different from casual virtual hackathons, weekend crypto hackathon or crypto conference. We disincentivize to do speed dating. Rather we encourage you do deep and long lasting relationships within your high signal peers. We will definitely try to choose right peers
