## 🕵️ Applicants

**What are we looking for?** As the saying goes, **"let your imagination guide you."**
We will review your social profiles in the following order: 
 1. _Github_,
 2. _Twitter_,
 3. _Linkedin_,
 4. _Telegram_

You can also earn bonus points if you have a _Strava or a Garmin_ account.

### 🌟 Why?

Our mission is to handpick 12-15 outstanding hackers for our inaugural cohort. This will allow them to flourish and help us refine our beta program. We anticipate challenges – after all, charting new territory can be full of surprises. However, our approach will be organic and adaptive.

Expect to immerse yourself in **our coworking space for 4 weeks**, complemented by a tailored sideline program. We hope that by the end, you'll have forged valuable relationships that will benefit your future endeavors.

### 🚀 Track Record Isn't Everything

A brilliant idea is just the starting point, but execution is paramount. Even if you're at the **toy stage** with your idea, this fellowship can help shape it into a fundable startup concept. Our approach is inspired by [Buildspace](https://buildspace.so/), and we believe that you can do **a lot** with the power of peer pressure from your fellow grinders.

### 🔥 Hot-topics to Explore

These are just some suggestions; however, we encourage all kinds of passion-driven projects. If you have a unique idea, go for it! And remember, our goal is genuine growth, not superficial contests. Success here means earning ecosystem grants, securing angel investments, or landing job offers. Treat this as a bootcamp to hone your skills and enjoy the journey.

Non-exhaustive list of topics includes:
- Wallets that rely on Account Abstraction
- Hacking with ERC-6551
- Flavored L2s, zk-X (Your creative use-case here!)
- On-chain NFTs
- Dynamic NFTs
- MUDs
- Autonomous on-chain games
- Hot mathematical proofs
- Blend of cryptoecon web3 and AI tooling

### Idea "Toy" Phase

We prefer to **host individuals who have done at least few iterations closer to PoC for their project and already have a tangible demo.** No worries if you don't, give it your best shot with your application and let's connect. If we have room, you could be the perfect fit!

### 📝 Want to Apply?

Reach out on our Telegram channel with the following (Note: We'll soon replace this with an online form):

**Existing Project in Toy Stage**:
- Your Github/Gitlab project repository
- Your Twitter handle
- Your Linkedin profile
- Why should we pick you?
- How can we assist in your project's success?
- What are your expectations from a 4-week stint with us?

### 🎁 What Will You Receive?

We offer guidance on technical and go-to-market strategies. Apart from a free coworking space, we might be able to subsidize part of your stay, based on our sponsorship deals. We'll do our utmost to help.

### 🧠 Are you Looking for Mentors as Well?

Yes we are!

Mentors should have a respected community presence. We'll check your followers and mutual connections. Financial aid may be available for 1-2 weeks' stay. Mentors should have startup experience, preferably in web3/AI companies, and could be **angel investors** or **scouts from VC funds**. It's essential that they embrace technology inclusively and ethically. 

Please share with us your Twitter, LinkedIn, Github, and tell us why you'd like to be a mentor in our SubWork fellowship.

### 📅 Key Dates for SubWork Fellowship #1?

We're considering launching in the last week of September, roughly around 30/9/2023.

### 🏞️ What is the SubWork Fellowship?

This is where the daily grind takes place, with several workshops happening on a daily basis, focusing on discussing and elaborating on disruptive topics. On a weekly basis, we incorporate an outdoor program to foster relationships through adventures, i.e. cold plunges, bathing in lakes, long-range hikes, ebike rides around local mountains to enjoy scenic views, and more.

We're focused on well-being, prolific code outputs, and funding strategies. The SubWork Fellowship is a foundational block for a broader SubWork vision: a tech village harmonized with nature.

### 🚫 Is it an Incubator?

Nope. We won't take any equity from your ideas. Instead, we want you to succeed globally. By playing positive sum games, we trust your success will benefit the community. Become a key player in this economic cycle.

### 🚀 What's in it for You?

It's an opportunity where proportionally to your time commitment, you can asymmetrically transform your life. It will be a transformational experience both for participants, mentors and collaborators. It will be diametrically different from casual virtual hackathons, weekend crypto hackathon or crypto conferences. We disincentivize "speed dating". Instead, we encourage you to build deep and long-lasting relationships with your high-signal peers.

### 💼 Capacity?

We're aiming for 12-15 hackers, but we'll launch with a minimum of 6. Fall season in the Bled area offers more affordable accommodations, and our space will likely be busy. After hosting **60+ people in Summer of 2023**, we're optimistic about the location's being a natural attractor.

### 🔄 Future Cohorts?

If this initiative thrives and garners positive feedback, we're excited to roll out another cohort either later this year or early next.

### 🎉 Will there be Other Hackathons Hosted at Subwork?

Absolutely! We have already a few of them scheduled. If you wish to attend a hackathon at our venue and potentially represent SubWork, you're more than welcome!
