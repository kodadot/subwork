> Ten routes have been listed as of utmost priority. The first group are larger hubs that can provide onward connectivity. They include: Vienna, Copenhagen, Athens, Madrid, Amsterdam and Helsinki. The second group of destinations are those aimed at point-to-point passengers. They include: Charleroi, Skopje, Prague and Berlin.
