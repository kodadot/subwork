_We are operating as a non-profit and looking to grow our space sustainably._

We are happy to give you a first tryout [for review on Google Maps](https://g.page/r/CWs7EEKFN9-zEBE/review) to explore cowork. 

However, as operating business _we need to cover our investments, running costs such as rent, and day-to-day resources_, like maintaining accessible and clean spaces for everyone.
