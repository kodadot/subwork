# membership in SubWork

_We are operating as non-profit and we are looking sustainably growing our space._

We are happy to give you first try out [for review on Google Maps](https://g.page/r/CWs7EEKFN9-zEBE/review), to explore cowork. 

If we are coworking you've been looking for. However as operating bussines _we need to cover our investments, running costs as rent and day-to-day resources_, like maintain accessible and clean space for everyone.
