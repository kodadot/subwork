We've tapped in Julian Alps with SubWork in 4/22 to demonstrate possibility of pop-up community to exists wrapped around aligned values, middle of nowhere.

After two years, we would like to **celebrate significant milestone as culmination of hosting over 200 high quality inviduals.** 

We are toying with idea setting up 2 week long Zuzalu styled pop-up village in magical Julian Alps. Among expected tracks we are looking to have emphasis on **Longevity, Hard & Deep Tech and Network States**.

Dates
---
- We are eyeballing end of September and begging of October. 
- Why those dates? Most of accomodation would be relaxed as Bled is small vilalge of 5k citizens which transforms into small capital with over 1M bookings over year, mostly during summer. Lot of families are incentivized enjoy tranquil nature and surroudings. 
- Optional dates could be early August, yet it's June writing this, it will take some significant amount to pull over dozens folks over to make plans.

Brief agenda
---
- During the week: After a healthy breakfast, you’ll spend the daytime in deep work. We provide infrastructure for you to be productive, whether you need a day of focus or want to run a retreat for your team or in a specific topic area. You will be in a beautiful place to work without having to worry about logistical details.
- In the evenings: There will be activities and opportunities to meet people, such as salons corresponding to that week’s theme and group bike rides in the surrounding Alpine country.
- Each weekend: We'll host unconferences on a variety of topics organized by relevant experts. At this point, the week-long participants will be joined by shorter-term visitors, injecting fresh energy into the popup village.
- By who: The village will be filled with high-agency people who are building towards this type of future: founders, scientists, urban planners, researchers, engineers, philosophers, storytellers, and beyond. We look for thoughtful people who are brilliant, curious, and kind.

Inspiration for ZuBled
---
Zuzalu shares elements of this vision. Its original instantiation was a 2-month popup village in a small beach town in Montenegro in 2023, which brought together 1,000+ people interested in a solarpunk future. The topics of focus were varied—crypto, longevity, AI, network states & new cities, zero-knowledge—and the unconference format focused on collective learning, collaboration, and building new frontier tech. The success of this event inspired dozens of similar projects, including [ZuConnect](https://www.zuzalu.city/), [Vitalia](https://vitalia.city/), [Mu](https://the-mu.xyz/), and many others [Zuzalu events upcoming](https://www.zuzalu.city/dashboard/home)

Concept of aligned community living in Bled
---
> Imagine living in a small town within walking distance of friends, family, and people you admire.

> On your way to the coworking space, you run into your favorite author in the town square. After a productive morning, a friend a few desks over invites you on a walk to brainstorm a hackathon project.

> Then, at dinner, everyone gathers for a healthy meal grown just over the hill. The mayor pops in to share an update on the upcoming art festival, alongside a jam-packed weekend on the latest in AI and Biotech.
