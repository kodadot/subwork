We've tapped in Julian Alps with SubWork in April 2022 to demonstrate possibility of long-term pop-up community to exists wrapped around aligned values, middle of nowhere. 

After two years, we would like to **celebrate significant milestone as culmination of hosting over 200 high quality inviduals.** 

We are toying with idea to setup up 2-6 week long Zuzalu themed pop-up village in magical Julian Alps. Among expected tracks we are looking to have emphasis on **Longevity, Hard & Deep Tech and Network States**.

Dates
---
- We are eyeballing range mid of September 2024 - mid of October 2024
- Right between [Zuitzerland](https://www.zuzalu.city/dashboard/eventview/about?event_space_id=58465703-768b-4138-92d5-1453416a901e) and [ETHLisbon 18-20th October](https://x.com/ETHLisbon/status/1760379799673946553)
- Why those dates? Most of accomodation would be relaxed off-seasson as **Bled is small village of 8k citizens which transforms into small capital with over [1M bookings over year](https://www.bled.si/en/information/business-pages/statistics/)**, mostly during summer. Lot of families are incentivized enjoy tranquil nature and surroudings.

Brief agenda
---
- During the week: After a healthy breakfast, you’ll spend the daytime in deep work. We provide infrastructure for you to be productive, whether you need a day of focus or want to run a retreat for your team or in a specific topic area. You will be in a beautiful place to work without having to worry about logistical details.
- In the evenings: There will be activities and opportunities to meet people, such as salons corresponding to that week’s theme and group bike rides in the surrounding Alpine country.
- Each weekend: We'll host unconferences on a variety of topics organized by relevant experts. At this point, the week-long participants will be joined by shorter-term visitors, injecting fresh energy into the popup village.
- By who: The village will be filled with high-agency people who are building towards this type of future: founders, scientists, urban planners, researchers, engineers, philosophers, storytellers, and beyond. We look for thoughtful people who are brilliant, curious, and kind.

Inspiration for ZuBled
---
Zuzalu shares elements of this vision. Its original instantiation was a 2-month popup village in a small beach town in Montenegro in 2023, which brought together 1,000+ people interested in a solarpunk future. The topics of focus were varied—crypto, longevity, AI, network states & new cities, zero-knowledge—and the unconference format focused on collective learning, collaboration, and building new frontier tech. The success of this event inspired dozens of similar projects, including [ZuConnect](https://www.zuzalu.city/), [Vitalia](https://vitalia.city/), [Mu](https://the-mu.xyz/), and many others [Zuzalu events upcoming](https://www.zuzalu.city/dashboard/home)

Concept of aligned community living in Bled
---
> Imagine living in a small town within walking distance of friends, family, and people you admire.

> On your way to the coworking space, you run into your favorite author in the town square. After a productive morning, a friend a few desks over invites you on a walk to brainstorm a hackathon project.

> Then, at dinner, everyone gathers for a healthy meal grown just over the hill. The mayor pops in to share an update on the upcoming art festival, alongside a jam-packed weekend on the latest in AI and Biotech.
